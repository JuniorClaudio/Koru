# Koru

Koru is an open source project that connects needs of people affected after a disaster with people looking to send help, in a way that informed actions can be taken and help can be better distributed.

Koru assists during the humanitarian aid and reconstruction stage after a disaster, with the objective to accelerate and organize the recovery of affected areas by quickly gathering and processing the needs of affected communities.
